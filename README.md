# Stage 5/5: No more restrictions
## Description
In the final stage, we will lift the image requirements of sharing the dimensions! But for simplicity, limit the watermark image â€” it must be smaller or equal to the original image. The error message for different dimensions of two images isn't valid anymore, so a new one will be used, in case a dimension of the watermark image is larger than the original image dimension.

In this stage, we will put a <b>single</b> watermark logo or several as a <b>grid</b>. Take a look at some examples:

![Watermark logo on top-left, top-right, bottom-left](example1.png)
<div style="text-align: center;">Top-left, Top-right and bottom-left</div>

![Watermark logo on bottom-right, in the middle and grid](example2.png)
<div style="text-align: center;">Bottom-right, in the middle and grid</div>

If users want to place a single watermark, ask for its position. The position is denoted by two integer numbers (`X` for horizontal and `Y` for vertical) that are the number of pixels from the top-left corner. `(0,0)` is the initial position (see the Figure below). `X` is a value from `0` to `<Image width - Watermark width>`, and `Y` is a value from `0 to <Image height - Watermark height>`:

The watermark pixels should be blended with the image pixels as in the previous stage. All other image pixels remain the same.

You may want to position the watermark as a grid. In this case, the watermark should be initially set at the top-left corner. Then repeat the watermark towards the right corner and the bottom until all space is covered.

## Objectives
- Compare the dimensions of the two images. If the watermark image has at least one dimension larger than the dimension of the original image, print `The watermark's dimensions are larger.` and terminate the program (Example 8);
- Before asking users for the output image filename, ask for the position method with `Choose the position method (single, grid):`, and read the user input. If this input isn't `single` or `grid`, print `The position method input is invalid.` and terminate the program (Example 5);
- If the user input is `single`, then print `Input the watermark position ([x 0-DiffX] [y 0-DiffY]):`, where `DiffX` is an integer equal to the subtraction `<Image width - Watermark width>`, and `DiffY` is an integer equal to the subtraction `<Image height - Watermark height>` (Examples 1 and 2). The position is two integers in the given range, separated by one space;
- If the position input is correct, create the output image as described in the Description section (Examples 1 and 2);
- If the position input isn't valid, print `The position input is invalid.` and terminate the program (Example 6);
- If the input integers are out of range, print `The position input is out of range.` and terminate the program (Example 7);
- If the user input is `grid`, create the output image as described in the Description section (Examples 3 and 4).
